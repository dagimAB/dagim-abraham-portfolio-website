Quick start (view locally)

Clone the repo: git clone https://github.com/dagimAB/dagim-abraham-portfolio-website.git
Open index.html in your browser to view the static site.
To test/contact form locally (if using PHP backend), run from repo root: php -S localhost:8000 Open http://localhost:8000
Development notes

Compiled CSS/JS files are included for deployment. SCSS sources and the working PHP/AJAX contact form are part of the template’s pro version.
If you want Sass workflow, add your own SCSS files and recompile with your preferred tool (dart-sass, node-sass, etc.).
To update the GitHub Pages deployment, push changes to the branch configured for Pages (usually main) and confirm Pages settings in the repo.
